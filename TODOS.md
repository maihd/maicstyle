# List of things todos
- Priority: Refactory to deep dive into study and research, more on workflow, use in real-life applications, combine with other languages/applications
- Practice templates: oneshot program to write in 30 minutes - 1 hour, and remove after that
- Advanced coding techniques:
    - Code path flow
    - Error handling
    - Effortless coding with C

- More examples: 
    - Hash table
    - Data structures

- Complete exercises
- Create webpage with docgen tools
- Create tools to demonstrate the ideas that worked
- API design guide lines, which is the best of how programming style should help
- Linked List vs Array performance benchmarks
    - Deep dive into implemenetation
    - Suggested usecases
    - Conclusion: 
        - No data structure are silver bullet
        - No perfection in real life software, and array is good enough data structure for common cases
