# C/C++ Programming language definitons
All features and extensions that should use for MaiCStyle


## Paradigms
- Make the job done
- Yolo coding from the start, you dont know the future, so should not always plan ahead (but experience and knowledge can help avoid some bad futures)
- Functional when logic are more important than performance
- Sometime imperative make the job more easily
- OOP have its place, but not everywhere

## C standard and extensions
- C99 is enough to use in all cases
- C11 if you need some things fancy, modern
- C2x never used
  

## C++ Extensions
- Designated initializer
  

## C++ avoid features
- RTTI, std::type_info. If Reflection and Serialization is needed, roll your own implementation.
- Exceptions, avoid as all costs.
- Deep and complex class inheritation hierarchy.
- Interface for polymorphism over class.
- No OOP and design pattern, prefer data structure and algorithm. Simple implementation.
